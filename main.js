We hope this message finds you well. We wanted to inform you that your reservation has been restricted due to a series of patterns that our system has identified. These patterns have triggered the restriction as a preventive measure to avoid events such as parties and maintain a safe and respectful environment for both hosts and guests. We understand that this news may come as a disappointment, and we empathize with any inconvenience this may cause.

Unfortunately, we are unable to remove this restriction at this time. It is in place to ensure the overall safety and comfort of our hosting community. We apologize for any frustration or inconvenience this may cause you.

However, please note that you are still able to book private rooms and hotel rooms within our platform. We encourage you to explore these options for your accommodation needs. Our hosts and hotels provide a variety of comfortable and welcoming spaces for you to enjoy during your stay.
